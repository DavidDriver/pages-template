    <div class="about">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a highly experienced software developer and technical project lead with a broad foundation in mainframe environments (z/OS, MVS/TSO) and extensive expertise in legacy languages like COBOL and CICS, as well as modern web technologies, RESTful APIs, and XML integration. Over my career, I’ve led teams through complex systems integrations, large-scale data conversions, and seamless migration of essential business applications, including HR, payroll, benefits, and manufacturing systems, to platforms such as PeopleSoft and SAP.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a strong background in both technical and functional roles, I specialize in aligning legacy systems with today’s advanced technological standards. My recent experience includes production support for pension administration, building automated reporting tools, and implementing security compliance measures in high-stakes environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I bring skills in audio and video production, as a certified Avid editor and sound mixer. This creative background complements my analytical expertise and adds versatility to the projects I can support.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I’m enjoying retirement, I'm open to interesting part-time or contract roles where I can bring value through my diverse skill set and mentoring capabilities. If you're looking for someone who can bridge the gap between traditional systems and emerging tech, let's connect!
